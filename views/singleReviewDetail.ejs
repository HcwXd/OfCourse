          This place is definitely so nice and such an amazing place for any type of event,
          birthday, meetings, socializing, date night, whatever you call it. It's super classy,
          security everywhere to make sure its safe. I asked what time they close and they said its
          up to whenever the customers want to leave. I thought that was pretty cool. There are 3
          stories, when you walk in, you can go down stairs where theres about 80 tap beers that you
          pour yourself. Pretty cool, then the main floor has a bar, and upstairs would be cocktails
          and mixed drinks. The mix drinks are a little pricey because the cup is so small, but like
          I said, its definitely a classy look to it. Pretty sure this place will blow up soon!
